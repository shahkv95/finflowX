1. Identify the financial APIs that you want to use to retrieve data about the user's investments. There are many financial APIs available that provide data on a wide range of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and more. Choose the APIs that will provide the data that you need for your tool.

2. Decide on the database technology that you want to use. You mentioned that you are considering either PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Both of these databases have their own strengths and are well-suited for different use cases. Consider the specific needs of your application and choose the database technology that will best support those needs.

3. Define the data model for storing portfolio information in the database. This should include the types of data that you will need to store (e.g., investment ticker symbols, prices, quantities, etc.), as well as any relationships between different pieces of data (e.g., a portfolio may contain multiple investments).

4. Implement the backend API using FastAPI and Python. Start by defining the APIs that the backend will expose and the data that will be returned by these APIs. Then, implement the logic for connecting to the financial APIs, retrieving data about the user's investments, and storing this data in the database.

5. Build the frontend web application using React and TypeScript. Design the user interface and implement the features that you have defined, such as the ability to view the portfolio, see how investments are performing over time, and add and remove investments from the portfolio.

6. Test and debug the tool. Thoroughly test the tool to ensure that it is functioning correctly and fix any issues that you encounter.

7. Deploy the tool using the Kubernetes API. Set up a production environment on a cloud platform or on-premises server and use the Kubernetes API to deploy and scale the application.
