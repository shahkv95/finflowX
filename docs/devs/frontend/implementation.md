### To get started building the monolithic frontend application for the investment portfolio tracker tool, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new React project using the create-react-app tool or your preferred method.

2. Add TypeScript to the project by following the instructions in the React documentation or using a tool like react-scripts-ts.

3. Create a login system for the application using a library like react-router or react-router-dom to handle routing and axios or fetch to make HTTP requests to the backend API. You may want to use a third-party authentication service like Auth0 or Okta to handle the login process.

4. Design and implement the dashboard for displaying the user's portfolio. This might involve creating components for displaying information about the portfolio summary, individual investments, and charts and graphs to visualize the performance of the investments.

5. Use a library like recharts or highcharts to create the charts and graphs for visualizing the performance of the investments. You will need to retrieve the data for the charts from the backend API using axios or fetch.

6. Test the frontend locally to make sure everything is working as expected.
