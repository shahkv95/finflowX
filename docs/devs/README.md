## Basic Plan for the implementation details of the project

1. Set up the development environment by installing the necessary software, such as a code editor, React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and Python. Choose a database (either PostgreSQL or MongoDB) and set it up.

2. Build the frontend of the application with React and TypeScript. This will involve creating a login system, a dashboard for displaying the user's portfolio, and various charts and graphs to visualize the performance of the investments.

3. Build the backend API with FastAPI and Python. The API will need to expose endpoints for retrieving and storing data in the database, as well as for interacting with financial APIs to pull in data about the user's investments.

4. Test the application locally to make sure everything is working as expected.

5. Use the Kubernetes API to deploy and scale the application in a production environment. This will involve creating a Docker image for the application, deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster, and setting up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

6. Test the application again in the production environment and make any necessary adjustments.
